# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

In preparation for my second Master's degree (this time in Computer Science), I'm brushing up on data structures and algorithms, and learning Java. This repo is just me practicing implementing stuff from scratch and doing some LeetCode to learn these topics a bit more deeply.

At the moment, my LeetCode solutions prioritize being easy to understand. I'll worry about improving efficiency in the future. :P
